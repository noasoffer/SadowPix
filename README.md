# ShadowPix

"SHADOWPIX: Multiple Images from Self Shadowing" implementation.
By creating different height surfaces that cast shadows on each other, a number of images can be created depending on the direction of the light.

As part of the project in the course: Algorithms for Modeling, Fabrication and Printing of 3D Objects, we implemented the two algorithms that appear in the paper.

## Local Method 

**run:**
```js
❯ python local_method.py
```
Mesh will be saved in to mesh_local.obj file. 

## Global Method 

**run:**
```js
❯ python global_method.py 
# Convergence might take some time
```
Mesh will be saved in to mesh_global.obj file.
